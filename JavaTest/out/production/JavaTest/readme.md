# Java test
For this please don't use any additional libraries. All code should be your own.

## Question 1
The interface ***MathematicalOperations*** has a method called *multiplyAndAdd*.

Change this method to take two arrays of type int as its parameters.

Next, create a class, name it however you deem appropriate. Implement the method you just changed, it should perform the following:

##### *multiply the value in arrayA at index i, with the value in arrayB at index i*

##### *keep a running sum total of these values*

##### *repeat for the entire length of the arrays*

##### *return the total sum*


## Question 2
Do the same calculation but this time remove all occurrences of the number 3 before calculating it.




### Hint ###

A[1] MULTIPLY BY B[1] + A[2] MULTIPLY BY B[2] .....
